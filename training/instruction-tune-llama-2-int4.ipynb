    "This blog post is an extended guide on instruction-tuning Llama 2 from Meta AI. The idea of the blog post is to focus on creating the instruction dataset, which we can then use to fine-tune the base model of Llama 2 to follow our instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to create a model which can create instructions based on input. The idea behind this is that this can then be used for others to create instruction data from inputs. That's especially helpful if you want to personalize models for, e.g., tweeting, email writing, etc, which means that you would be able to generate an instruction dataset from your emails to then train a model to mimic your email writing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so can we get started on this? In the blog, we are going to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define our use case in detail and create a prompt template for our instructions\n",
    "2. Create an instruction dataset\n",
    "3. Instruction-tune Llama 2 using `trl` and the `SFTTrainer` \n",
    "4. Test the Model and run Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Define our use case in detail and create a template for our instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we describe our use case, we need to better understand what even is an instruction. \n",
    "\n",
    "> An instruction is a piece of text or prompt that is provided to an LLM, like Llama, GPT-4, or Claude, to guide it to generate a response. Instructions allow humans to steer the conversation and constrain the language model's output to be more natural, useful, and aligned with the user's goals. Crafting clear, well-formulated instructions is key to productive conversations.\n",
    "> \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of instructions are listed below in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Capability | Example Instruction |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| Brainstorming | Provide a diverse set of creative ideas for new flavors of ice cream. |\n",
    "| Classification | Categorize these movies as either comedy, drama, or horror based on the plot summary. |\n",
    "| Closed QA | Answer the question 'What is the capital of France?' with a single word. |\n",
    "| Generation | Write a poem in the style of Robert Frost about nature and the changing seasons. |\n",
    "| Information Extraction | Extract the names of the main characters from this short story. |\n",
    "| Open QA | Why do leaves change color in autumn? Explain the scientific reasons. |\n",
    "| Summarization | Summarize this article on recent advancements in renewable energy in 2-3 sentences. |\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in the beginning, we want to fine-tune a model to be able to generate instructions based on input. (output). We want to use this as a way to create synthetic datasets to personalize LLMs and Agents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Converting the idea into a basic prompt template following the [Alpaca format](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca#data-release) we get. \n",

    "## 2. Create an instruction dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "After we defined our use case and prompt template, we need to create our instruction dataset. Creating a high-quality instruction dataset is key for a good-performing model. Research shows that [“Less Is More for Alignment”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206) shows that creating a high-quality, low-quantity (~1000 samples) dataset can achieve the same performance as less-quality and high-quantity datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to create an instruction dataset, including: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using an existing dataset and converting it into an instruction dataset, e.g., [FLAN](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SirNeural/flan_v2)\n",
    "2. Use existing LLMs to create synthetically instruction datasets, e.g., [Alpaca](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tatsu-lab/alpaca)\n",
    "3. Use Humans to create instructions datasets, e.g., [Dolly](https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k). \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the methods has its own advantages and disadvantages and depends on the budget, time, and quality requirements. For example, using an existing dataset is the easiest but might not be tailored to your specific use case, while using humans might be the most accurate but can be time-consuming and expensive. It is also possible to combine several methods to create an instruction dataset, as shown in [Orca: Progressive Learning from Complex Explanation Traces of GPT-4.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02707)\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep it simple, we are going to use **[Dolly](https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k)** an open-source dataset of instruction-following records generated by thousands of Databricks employees in several of the behavioral categories outlined in the **[InstructGPT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155)**, including brainstorming, classification, closed QA, generation, information extraction, open QA, and summarization.\n",
