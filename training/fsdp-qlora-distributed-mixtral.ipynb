    "Open LLMs like Meta [Llama 2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf), Mistral AI [Mistral](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) & [Mixtral](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1) models or TII [Falcon](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b) brought a lot of progress in the last year. We went from no OpenAI competitor to a whole zoo of LLMs, which can be used for a variety of tasks. However, most of the time you need to fine-tune the model on your data or use case to get the full potential of the model. Fine-tuning smaller LLMs, like Mistral became very accessible on a single GPU by using Q-Lora. But efficiently fine-tuning bigger models like Llama 2 70b or Mixtral stayed a challenge until now. \n",
